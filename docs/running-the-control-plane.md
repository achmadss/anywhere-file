# Running the control plane locally

`hosted/control-plane/` needs PostgreSQL. `hosted/control-plane/docker-compose.yml` brings one up on host
port 5433.

```sh
cd hosted/control-plane
docker compose up -d
export RFM_DATABASE_URL='postgres://rfm:rfm@localhost:5433/rfm?sslmode=disable'
go run . migrate up          # `migrate down [n]` reverses
go run . serve               # :8443, HTTP unless RFM_TLS_CERT and RFM_TLS_KEY are set
curl -s localhost:8443/healthz
```

The Go tests that touch the schema need the same database, under a separate variable so that
a stray `go test` cannot wipe a development one. They drop and recreate the `public` schema,
so point it at a throwaway:

```sh
RFM_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://rfm:rfm@localhost:5433/rfm?sslmode=disable' go test ./...
```

Without it those tests skip, and a skip looks like a pass. CI runs them against PostgreSQL
on the ubuntu runner and fails if the invite race test did not actually run.
